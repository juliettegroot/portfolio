          Hi my name is Juliette Groot and I am in my second year of the study Communication and Multimedia Design. 
          I was born December 16th, 2003 and I have always loved to do creative things like draw, write, paint and create new things.
        </p>

        <p>
          CMD introduced me to Html, css and javascript and I was immediatly captivated. 
          I love to learn and get better at writting html, css and javascript and my goal is to get a greater understanding of this and other coding language to create something beatifull with it in the future!
          Besides the Front-end side of a website or app, I also really enjoy learning and creating designs that are different and work well.
